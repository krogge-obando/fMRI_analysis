# 🧠 General codes to conduct fMRI analysis
Here, I will put general scripts to conduct fMRI analysis during my research initiatives.

# ⭐ Highlights

The code here show how to derive a seedbased correlation, and conduct t-maps to look at group differences of interesing behavioral measures.

## 📎 How to navigate this repo??
This repo was designed with these folders
1. codes: to see the code I have in this repo you may go here and download from here.

## 🧭 Sofware I used

Matlab version 2024a

Matlab was used to derive fMRI measures and analysis

## 💻 Codes

- derive_insula_map.m - code that derives the insula whole brain seed based correaltion time course and maps, storing it after being z scored.
- run_seedfc_analysis.m - code that derives t-maps for group differences (patients with schizophrenia and control group) over the measures of interest.

## ❓ Have Questions
